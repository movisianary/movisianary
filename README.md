- 👋 Hi, I’m @movisianary
- 👀 I’m interested in platform development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning newbie on system design  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:: 
- Dear Team
- Customers has job is on top of his desk are looking for a supplier who can provide commision, on the other hand for the new firm to get new customers is an headache.  they are ready to give commission in order to attract more and more. but they doesn't know how to recorgnize a customers who has job on his desk. using customer point of Reference can be an answer. customers rpoint of reference are either a coworkers or suppliers of other product in a particular firm. using qrcode will be easy to administrator to know who has refer to whom and both the buyer and the point of reference can get commission.

I would like to know wether someone or group of experts can develop this kind of platform for me.
regards
